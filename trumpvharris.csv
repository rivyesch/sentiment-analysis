"""Do you believe that America was better four years ago?"" Kamala: Let me take you through a journey of my childhood"
"Statements I NEVER thought I'd hear during a presidential debate: ""THEY'RE EATING THE PETS!"""
"Do you believe Americans are better off now than they were 4 years ago? Harris"" I was raised middle class and had a nanny."""
The fact that they shook hands in the beginning is ending me
"""You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time."" Abraham Lincoln."
Kamala is not directly answering the questions. Donald is not directly answering the questions. The comment section on every one of these debate videos is full of bots. Is the internet is already dead?
How can she just sit there and act like prices ain't higher
Everytime trump is talking “Okay your time is up we have a lot to get to”
The comments on here are hilarious; the US education system must be in total chaos.
Trumps facial expressions are killing me
"Question: ""How would you fix this problem if you became president?"" Answer: ""Well I would do it right and he/she would do it wrong"" This debate makes me feel like I could run for president too"
"We’re literally struggling to pay bills and buying groceries, credit card debt is at the all time high, imagine what we all could accomplish if we all grouped up and said enough is enough"
She seriously talked about unemployment 4yrs ago like we were not in a global pandemic
Q: do you believe Americans are better off economically than 4 years ago? A: I'm from middle class
"Kamala Harris: ""Donald Trump has no economic plan"" - proceeds to spend the next several minutes attacking Trump's economic plan"
"I don't need to see the debate ...I've been to the grocery store , the gas station , paid electric bills , insurance , etc for the last 7 years . I know the difference and YOU do too. The debate is over"
The way I see presidential debates is that it is a show of two people roasting each other and not talking about a solution for the real problems we have now. What's the point of all this circus?
YOU NEVER SAW THIS WOMAN DURING BIDEN
For some awkward reason this looks like the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard Court hearing.
Why is Kamala never getting fact checked?
Why is she shaking her head when he talks about inflation. You have to be blind not to see the high cost of everything!
No one is answering to anything. They both are avoiding for direct answer. What they are doing is blaming each other and not addressing the real issue.
What's her childhood have to do with the last four years of the United States.
If she was fixing everything why isn't she getting done .she's in office.
Did she really blame a global pandemic on Trump???
What good is a tax cut if you dont have a job
One person is telling the truth and the other person is playing politics.
Trump how are you Trump : we spend billions and billions of dollars
He’s lying that was Obama economics
"I love how she keeps saying, “which I have a plan for” but never reveals the plan."
"If they can barely afford healthcare, I promise you they’re not going to be able to afford IVF. That is ridiculous."
"Is it just me but they are treating Harris much different,fact checking everything Trump says."
Trump brought up illegal immigration on every subject but didn't want to talk about it when he was accused of cancelling the bill that would have helped with illegal immigration
This was hard to finish… Trump only talked about immigrants
the hosts of this debate were so unprofessional and biased. no reason trump doesnt want to debate again because its set up against him.
I’d like to see a debate where Trump only has to debate the other candidate..
"Wow she outed him ""He picked up the phone and called ""some people"" and had the bill killed."" Good for her. She beats him all day."
She totally avoided the subject of illegal immigration
Why can't Kamala answer a simple question?
"How can you do an abortion ""after birth"" ? Lol"
Why did Kamala introduce herself like Trump didn’t know who she was
So people that were fired by Trump don’t like Trump. Wow that’s amazing. That’s what you’re standing on?
Why are the moderators giving information against either opponent but it’s only against Trump? They are moderators. They’re just supposed to keep the person within the time limit and to make sure the attacks don’t get personal.
Trump: I got 75 mil votes Me/KAMALA: 81mil PPL FIRED YOU
Harris has been there for 3.5 years... what has she done?
Harris didnt answer the question ARE AMERICANS BETTER OFF TODAY THAN 4 YEARS AGO
"The prices of everything is just 1.5x or 2x higher than even 2 years ago, Kam ala has no guts to address this"
Trump can't even listen my goodness..very childish!
Both sides are pathetic. The democratic and the repupublic party need to be disbanded. This cannot be democracy. Choose between these two idiots once every four years...
First and top of mind impression: ABC is the new CNN
"He is for the rich, she is for the middle class,who is for the poor?"
"She talks a lot, but she actually doesn’t say anything"
When Kamala says that the government shouldn't be telling people what to do with their bodies does that also apply to vaccine mandates?
Let's remember when she helped people who loot and destroy public property and desecrate monuments. She help THEM get out of jail.
"Her boss, if you can call him the boss, he spends his time at the beach"
It’s funny that Harris dances around the question and then spend half her time bashing Donald knowing he’s going to defend himself. That tells me she’s scaredddd!!!!
"these interviewers workers are with kamala lol, thats not fair"
"I had to watch this for myself as I can’t trust MSM, and glad I watched it and didn’t trust the sound bites from the media"
Thank you for the many common sense people pointing out that Kamala has said nothing in all the words she spoke
Definitely a 3v1 lol you can hear it in their tones whenever they try to cut Trump short on whatever point he makes towards Harris its laughable really.
"Drink every time Trump says ""There's never been anything like it."""
"""Why did you kill the border bill."" ""First let me talk about the rallies."" lol"
"""so you dont have a plan?"" ""i have a concept of a plan"" interesting...."
"""I told Abdul don't do it anymore, Abdul said how do you have a picture of my house"" this guy is nuts"
"Each of the candidates should have been required to wear shock collars. And anytime the candidate lies, they should experience a jolt of electricity."
"""donald trump was fired by 81 million people"" I SCREAMED LMAO"
Moderators were a disappointment ...
The fact that they blocked comments on the live stream says a lot
"I miss the Romney Obama debates, very few interruptions, less need for corrections and fact checks. No name calling. Focusing on policy, like the government should. The system is broken and there isn't any option to fix it since third party votes are wasted. You can't fix the system from the inside until everyone agrees its broken. Remember when you vote this isn't about the person, they are an instrument for their parties beliefs, otherwise they wouldn't have been nominated"
"For being a so called ""tough guy"" , trump sure gets triggered pretty fast and seems to fanboy over dictators around the world"
"Why do they let him ramble on, not answering the question? Why is there no fact checking his answers, which are clearly nonsense?"
The more of this I watch the more I feel like Trump is one of my drunk uncles that traps me in a conversation on Christmas Day…this is just as awkward and sad.
"What kind of debate is this? No counter questioning, no follow up."
"""She gave it all to the Taliban!"" he said, while sitting at a table with the Taliban leaders in Camp David, signing a deal to give it all to the Taliban..."
If you looked to the debate to make your decision… I’d encourage you to just compare today to 5 years ago Because you literally have lived both presidencies.
To imagine….these are the ONLY two people capable of running the country
I was expecting ABC to manage the debate far better.
This 'debate' could have been an email
Can someone count how many times Trump spoke on the muted mic and the host just let him?
"kamala was never middle class, she traveled the world with her mom and dad"
Worst and unfair moderated event ever!
“Let’s understand what happened here.” Her catch phrase
Kamala and her party waited too late. If she had only spent the last four years with this type of communication.
"The ABC moderators should be ashamed and embarrassed by their highly prejudiced treatment of the candidates in the debate. They did a terrible job and were shining examples of why most people do not trust the media anymore. ABC should be ashamed if these three ""journalists"" are the best they can offer!"
"Trump knows how to talk to Putin. It goes something like this: ""Yes, daddy. Whatever you say, daddy. You're so strong and brave, sir."" "
She totally avoided the immigration question. Make it make sense.
She's basically saying she will pay for you to vote for her. Just like she paid for a rapper to do a show at her rally to get people to go to it.
This debate confirmed why I’m not longer supporting the Democratic Party. Kamala had 4 years and didn’t do shit.
Most unfair and unprofessional debate. ABC a new low.
Our economy is in shambles. Anyone who votes for 4 more years of this will help throw us into a real depression
There are currently soldiers in a combat zone. Iraq and Syria have soldiers being attacked. Two battle carrier groups are in the South China Sea.
ABC moderators were the worst of any debate ever seen! Why would anyone care about what they interrupted with? We wanted to hear the 2 candidates. The moderators ruined this debate!
"First question: When it comes to the economy, do you believe Americans are better off than they were 4 years ago? Harris: So I was raised as a middle class kid."
Who cares about the debate. I'm still voting for Trump.
It saddens me to see how corrupt our media really is.
Both of them had served in the White House. The question that voters need to ask is “Is my life better now after 3-1/2 years of Biden/Harris administration? Or was my life better during Trump’s administration?”
Do you think the economy is as good as it was 4 years ago? “ I was raised as a middle class kid “
Debates don't define who is the best candidate only track records do.
why isn't she answering the question: is the economy better off
"Why are the moderators always so nice to Kamala and so antagonising to Trump? It's like they want her to win, for some reason. I don't know, I'm not American, but that's the feeling I got."
"i see 1 vs 3, moderators keep asking trump and adding info while he speaks but not asking anything the woman while she speaks"
Trump actually nailed this debate. The only reason she’s coming off so good is that she’s not Biden who is a dementia patient
3 1/2 years is not enough for Kamala to clean up your mess
this debate is so rigged against trump bruh
Moderator to Trump: why are you so bad? Moderator to Harris: why is Trump so bad?
She been with Biden all this time not one thing has got better
Rigged debate! Trump had to debate 3 people
Boy ! I didn't realize how great of an actress Kamilla Harris really is.
"All one has to do is watch Vice President Harris everytime President Trump speaks to know that electing her would be a disaster. Reacting to everything based purely on emotions before thinking it out. Women, and men who began smoking weed at a very young age all behave like this. Zero ability to regulate emotions."
"Is there a real face or emotion that Kamala is capable of. Really obnoxious to watch, seems like there isn’t a real thing about Kamala."
That man is embarrassing.. half of this is just him rambling. People are truly voting a man that can’t debate properly without lying every second?
She did a crap job at prosecuting- just look at San Francisco
Why there was no fact checking for Kamala?
The fact-checking of the moderators .... ridiculous
"She talkimg about the border, ahaha she havent been to the border."
"Smoked weed, put folks in prison for weed Owns a gun Supports mandatory gun by back Affordable Care Act did hurt a lot of people- by way of jacking up rates; but, it did also do some good things. Strengthening is a must And they need to also do more"
Trump won the debate even though he was 3 on 1.
1 v 3... Shameless ABC.
As an independent I was really looking forward to an honest representation of both candidates. ABC completely sided with Harris and didn’t treat Trump fairly. 100% voting for Trump. He showed incredible strength debating 3 opponents.
To me from the UK its looks like the people asking the questions are in Harris's side.
So WHY did they not follow up and ask Kamala Harris WHAT SHE IS - why did they not ask her HOW COME she said she was an Indian and then saying she's black... why not get that out in the open!??!! They were not impartial - they were on her side - so evident...
I like how when they first come out and shake hands she says Kamala Harris like he didn't know who she was. LoL just an example of rehearsed responses without any independent thoughts
"I am a Democrat, and after this I will be voting for Trump. All she did was lie."
Make America Great Again!
Kamala the kommy
ABC just showed the world that Kamala can’t do it on her own. Thank you ABC
the past 4 years everyone is pointing fingers So whos is at fault? Kamala and Biden
I'm yet to hear a single true statement from Kamala
Lost by a whisker means he lost. Why did the moderator say he still thinks he didn't lose?
trump is trying so desperately to grow fears with every sentence that comes out of his mouth...its incredible.
I want to thank ABC for blatantly exposing their democratic bias.
Her constanting reacting was so distracting I had to cover up right side of the screen with hand so I could focus on what Trump is saying.
"Watching for a second time, with some time in between when I viewed it live. Trump is insane. Completely bonkers. Psychotic. He absolutely cannot become POTUS ever again!! He's a horror show!"
"I watched this debate twice, I don’t see where Harris answered the question that was posed to her"
"Not fair , Harris was allowed to have Linebackers on the field"
"This debate was sooo biased against Trump, David Muir and Lisa whoever should be fired"
kamala harris completely dodged and ignored the first question
"I was a nurse in Vietnam. I know the war in Ukraine is useless. Your welcome for my help, holding & helping those in Vietnam. Yes, even children there. I did not like Harris' smirk at all. Try going to Ukraine folks. I know"
"I’m not even American and the comment section baffles me. Debates 10 years ago were intelectual conversations. They give you glimpses of what each candidate stands for. Harris essentially aced that debate. Eye contact, steady, presented affirmed vision in a term, while gratefully defending herself and coming back to her value of the American people. Yet…witness Trump. He expresses no clear vision, all chaos, no plans? Where are your policies? continues to attack with nonsense. It’s actually laughable how frightening how much supporters he has. Then you see the comment section praising trump? Baffling. Kamala deserves some praise especially with this debate. Give it to her."
Kamala Harris 2024
No one is going to talk about how harris never touches her left side of her hair. She is not trying to show that ear piece !
"""I'm Winning...he sounds like Charlie Sheen. We know where that led... Winning."
"I came for a presidential debate, got the gaslighting Olympics. Both are crap, but I'm more interested in the people they're bringing with them to the white house at this point, and the better choice is pretty clear."
From a Canadian God bless this man. ABC makes me sick to my stomach you are going back lol ..fools for her?
"I’m voting Trump, LETS GO TRUMP"
"“Voters don’t vote on numbers and data” literally the dumbest thing said. Pre debate. So we vote on personality and not facts? Then we are doomed either way. Don’t know that I’d like trump personally, but trump 2024"
I’m a Democrat but voting Trump. I can’t watch our country get destroyed any more
Harris was put in because the Democrats had no better candidate after Joe was put to sleep. Harris has been there 3+ years and has played a passive role. I don't think we need 4 more years of this.
She Got Destroyed and She even knew the questions before they began
Trump lost BIGLY
If Kamala was going to help America ????. She would have done it in her first term
She's wearing an earpiece ...All of her answers have a bit of a pause...which means she's listening in and repeating
ABC your ridiculous
"I am not from US , but from a neutral perspective the Hosts were clearly biased and interrupting Trump too often and also countering trump and giving complete advantage to Kamala."
Kamela answered the first question really quick hmm !!! Ya I'm sure she was not told the questions ahead of time. lol
"As a prosecutor, if all you ever asked was... ""are you ok?"" Then you were a terrible prosecutor, just like you were a terrible vice president, and you'll drag this country into the dirt a president. Good thing you will never make it!"
Can't wait for the snl sketch
I was stunned when she said that Trump rallies were people are leaving early in fact her own rallies where people are leaving earlier even though they were paid for it and bused in and out. She is disgusting liar
poor Trump. i think he is done now.
"Based on my analysis of the debate transcript, it would not be fair to say the moderators were clearly biased in favor of Harris. Here's why: Equal time: Both candidates appeared to receive roughly equal speaking time and opportunities to respond. Challenging questions: The moderators posed challenging questions to both candidates. For example, Harris was pressed on her shifting policy positions and her role in the current administration's policies. Fact-checking: The moderators fact-checked both candidates when they made questionable claims. For instance, they corrected Trump on his claims about immigrants eating pets and challenged Harris on some of her statements about abortion. Follow-ups: The moderators asked follow-up questions to both candidates when they avoided directly answering questions. Topic balance: The debate covered a wide range of topics, including ones that could be seen as favorable or challenging to both candidates. Interruptions: The moderators appeared to manage interruptions from both candidates fairly. However, perceptions of bias can be subjective and influenced by one's own political leanings. It's not uncommon for supporters of each candidate to feel their candidate was treated unfairly. It's also worth noting that Trump and some of his supporters expressed frustration with the moderation. This is a common tactic used by candidates to potentially deflect from a performance they feel didn't go well. Also, it is clear that Trump made far more absurd claims, such as immigrants eating pets, so it is reasonable to expect correspondingly greater attention to such claims."
"Anyone hear Trump say he's not president right now? Little clip that should be played on repeat for all his true believers. Please America, vote Harris."
I have no idea who to vote but I am done with the two party system
I love how the moderators fact checked Trump live during the debate while refusing to do the same this to Kamala. They turned this into a three on one debate.
Just remember how Harris political career started ...... sleeping with a politician.
"Harris, get the earbuds out of your ear! We can see it."
she somehow reminds me of key & peele when they immitate Obama
"for those who don't know, Kamala was trying to back out of this debate the last several days and then she shows up with Nova wireless earrings. Hmm."
Harris is a clown
I hope she gets to be President. She is a great woman.
"Trump has the focus, short term memory, and problem solving mentality of a toddler"
Looking forward to four more years of Making America Great Again.
Her trying to sound like Obama is DEFINITELY not gonna work
"You can tell he respects her intelligence. He has donated to her attorney general campaign 2x in the past. As a conservative Canadian, it upsets me at HOW black and white American politics have to be. What I appreciate about DT is his libertarian views and exposure of corruption in the democratic party and the media, but what lacks is his humility and ability to articulate. Kamala is incredibly bright. She was phenomenal in this debate, and I believe if she wasn’t tied to Biden, people would like her 10x more. They would be great if they were working together, honestly."
this woman will be the end of america
"Well done, Harris."
HARRIS WIPED THE FLOOR with tCHUMP
She’s just fantastic!
She did a horrible job. What are these people watching
"These two people are just competing at who can insult, accuse, and undermine the other candidate more. There is nothing else that they can offer to the people. So sad, America"
